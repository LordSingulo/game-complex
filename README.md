# Game Complex
This is a game idea generator. I liked some of the other game idea generators I searched for online, but I felt like I could change the ideas that were generated to better suit what I think of when I am brainstorming.

I used Angular to make this project as I use it for work and I wanted to explore some areas I don't normally get to at work. Initially this project was in Godot 3.5.1 but I was having trouble getting the font scaling to work right at smaller resolutions. Instead of hosting the Godot project on itch.io, I decided to host it here on GitHub Pages instead with Angular.

## Categories
The categories are Themes, Goals, Settings, and Wildcards.

Themes implies how a player's goals tie into broader narrative themes.

Goals give a clear direction for the player.

Settings determine the feature of the surrounding world. I decided to generate two at a time because I kept getting interesting combinations you don't normally see, which allowed my creative mind to rationalize why medieval and modern ideas might belong together for example. Renaissance fair, anyone?

Lastly, I absolutely loved the idea of Wildcards from [Godot Wild Jam](https://godotwildjam.com/). They can potentially help make an idea stand out.

## Layout
For the overall layout of the page, I really liked how [monochroma380's Game Idea Generator](https://monochroma380.itch.io/game-idea-generator) looked and felt. I wanted to incorporate parts of its design in combination with my original idea for this project, which was to use cards.

During testing, since the cards were stacked on top of each other, I had to click to move them in order to see the icons and text, which hampered the overall brainstorming process. The cards were really nice to look at though so maybe I will be able to use them for a future project.

## Credits
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.2.

Icons were from [Game-icons.net](https://game-icons.net/) by many contributors.

Fonts were by [jeti on dafont.com](https://www.dafont.com/jeti.d1589).
